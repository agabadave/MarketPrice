MarketPrice
===========

MarketPrice Server Side implementation developed in ASP.NET. Framework used was MVC 5 with SQL support. Entity Framework was used as the Object-Relational Mapping tool. Code First approach was used and Entity Framework generated the database and its requirements. Therefore no SQL implementation was needed.

Application was also built with Web API 2 technologies which gave support for clients to get access. Once deployed, application can be accessed on http://localhost/MarketPrices/ while the Web API can be accessed on http://localhost/MarketPrices/api/.
